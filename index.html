      <h1>Hassan Nofisat Adetola</h1>
      <h2 id="#aboutme">About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Hassan Nofisat Adetola, I'm 20 years old and I'm from
        Osun state. I currently live in Ibadan and sometimes, Lagos. I'm a final
        year student of Fountain University, Osogbo and I'm studying Computer
        Science.<br />
        I am a student of the Software Engineering school in AltSchool Africa
        and I am currently enrolled in the
        <strong>Back-end engineering track.</strong> My AltSchool ID is
        <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2632.</strong><br />
        I'm quite an introvert and I really love watching movies and reading
        books. If I'm not doing these two things, I would be scrolling through
        either twitter or tiktok. I'm also learning to love programming:)
      </p>

      <h2 id="#reason">Why I joined AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I'm in AltSchool because I realised I needed a structured and efficient
        way to learn to be a Software Developer. I've been trying to learn how
        to code since 2020 and I haven't made any significant progress. It has
        been such a drag because I've wasted so much time and achieved very
        little. And it's made me come to the realization that I need proper
        guidance if i ever want to be a developer.
      </p>

      <h2 id="#goals">My goals in AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to be an amazing Software Developer. I want to be able to
        solve difficult problems by writing pograms. I want to be so good in
        writing code that I think up solutions to any problems thrown at me. I
        also plan to be excellent enough so I find a job as a Software Developer
