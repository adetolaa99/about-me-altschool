      <h1>Hassan Nofisat Adetola</h1>
      <h2 id="#aboutme">About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Hassan Nofisat Adetola, I'm from Osun state, Nigeria and
        I'm 20 years old. I live in Ibadan and sometimes I'm in Lagos.<br />
        I'm a final year student of Fountain University and I'm studying
        Computer Science. I'm also a student of the Software Engineering school
        in AltSchool Africa. I am currently enrolled in the
        <strong>Back-end engineering track</strong> and my AltSchool ID is
        <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2632.</strong><br />
        I'm quite an introvert and I really love watching movies and reading
        books. If I'm not doing those two things, I would be scrolling through
        either twitter or tiktok. I'm also learning to love programming:)
      </p>

      <h2 id="#reason">Why I joined AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I'm in AltSchool because I realised I needed a structured and efficient
        way to learn to be a Software Developer. I've been trying to learn how
        to code since 2020 and I have barely made any progress. It has been such
        a drag because I've wasted so much time and achieved very little. And
        it's made me come to the realization that I need proper guidance if i
        ever want to be a programmer.
      </p>

      <h2 id="#goals">My goals in AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to be an amazing Software Developer. I want to be able to
        solve difficult problems by writing pograms. I want to be so good in
        writing code that I think up solutions to any problems thrown at me. I
        also plan to be excellent enough so I find a job as a Software Developer
